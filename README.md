# Dodge-the-Creeps
Godot game I created following a GDScript Tutorial

My first game created with Godot and the GDscript language, I have alway wanted to be a games developer so picking up this game was so much fun
The aim of the game is simple DODGE THE CREEPS! and stay alive as long as you can, the longer you stay alive the more points you  get
points are equal to time stayed alive!

I coded everything following the tutorial, I did add the controller functionality by myself though
